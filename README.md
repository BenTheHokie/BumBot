## About

The bot was created by LemonSourKid using [Alain Gilbert](https://github.com/alaingilbert)'s [ttapi.](https://github.com/alaingilbert/Turntable-API) This was built concurrent with my [bot template,](https://github.com/lemonsourkid/TTapi-Python-Template) so you will find that much of the code is copied.
