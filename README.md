This is a bot for [theSpeakeasy room](http://turntable.fm/thespeakeasy) on [Turntable.fm](http://turntable.fm).
Note: If you try to enter the room on a non-Wednesday and you are not a mod, you will be auto-booted by the bot. Otherwise, come in and enjoy the tunes.

## Instructions

/beerme
/roundofbeers

The bot will automatically greet users and "give them a beer" when users enter.

## About

The bot was created by LemonSourKid using [Alain Gilbert](https://github.com/alaingilbert)'s [ttapi.](https://github.com/alaingilbert/Turntable-API) This was built concurrent with my [bot template,](https://github.com/lemonsourkid/TTapi-Python-Template) so you will find that much of the code is copied.
